# WBZ
A parallel implementation of the bzip2 data compressor in python, this data compression pipeline is using algorithms like **Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (BWT)** and **Move to front (MTF)** to improve the **Huffman compression**. For now, this tool only will be focuses on compressing .csv files and other files on tabular format.

  When we talk about computation time we are also talking about money, data compression represents the most appropriate economic way to shorten the gap between content creators and content consumers, compressed files are obviously smaller, it is necessary less money and time to transfer them and cost less money to store them, content creators pay less money to distribute their content, and content consumers pay less money to consume content. On the other hand, companies in all sectors need to find new ways to control the rapidly growing volume of their heterogeneous data generated every day, data compression and data decompression tools are related as one of the most viable solutions to these problems. In fact, data compression and decompression techniques are the DNA of many famous distributed systems and part of their success is due to the proper use of these techniques.
