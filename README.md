# WBZ
A parallel implementation of the bzip2 data compressor in python, the pipeline is using algorithms like Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) and Move to front (MTF) to improve the huffman compression. For now this tool only will be focuses on compressing .csv files, and other tabular format files.
